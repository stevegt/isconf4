<H1>NAME</H1>

<P>
isconf - infrastructure build and configuration manager
</P>

<A NAME="toc2"></A>
<H1>SYNOPSIS</H1>

<P>
<B>isconf</B> [<B>-Dhrq</B>] <CODE>[</CODE><B>-c</B> <I>config</I>] <CODE>[</CODE><B>-m</B> <I>message</I>] <I>verb</I> [<I>verb_args</I>] ...

<H1>QUICK START</H1>

<P>
First, follow the short installation instructions in the INSTALL file
that came with this package.  It's best to do this on whatever you're
using as a golden master image, then deploy that image to all of your
machines.  If you're only setting up a few machines and have no image
server, then you <I>might</I> be able to get away with installing each
manually from the vendor CD, if you carefully install them each the
same way.
</P>
<P>
Later, to install the latest version of package 'foo' on ten thousand
hosts, including any hosts that are currently down or not yet built,
you can log into any host and say this:
</P>

<PRE>
      cd /tmp
      wget http://example.com/foo-1.2.tar.gz  
      isconf start
      isconf lock just a comment about installing foo
      isconf snap foo-1.2.tar.gz  
      isconf exec tar -xzvf foo-1.2.tar.gz 
      isconf exec make -C foo-1.2 install
      isconf exec rm -rf foo-1.2.tar.gz foo-1.2
      isconf ci
</PRE>

<P>
...then, on the other 9,999 hosts, run this during boot or from cron:
</P>

<PRE>
      isconf start
      isconf up
</PRE>

<P>
If you're only managing a few machines, you can probably get away with
not starting the isconf daemon at boot -- as above, just start it
manually when you need it by saying 'isconf start'.  If you're turning
these machines over to someone else for long-term support, don't want
to teach them isconf, and expect them to manually make a mess anyway,
then it would make sense to leave the daemon off when you're done
anyway.  See <B>BUGS/RESTRICTIONS</B> for some security reasons why it
also makes sense to leave the daemon off when you're done.
</P>

<A NAME="toc4"></A>
<H1>DESCRIPTION</H1>

<P>
See the GLOSSARY below for terms and concepts.
</P>
<P>
ISconf can be thought of as a cross between <B>sudo</B>(8) and a
distributed version control tool like Git or Bitkeeper.  Changes you
make via ISconf are journaled and added to a distributed repository,
queuing them for execution on other target machines.  Those other
target machines do not need to be running, or even be built, at the
time you check in changes.  As you turn on, build, reboot, and/or run
'isconf up' on other machines, ISconf consults the journal and
executes the same changes, in the same order, on each machine.
</P>
<P>
The ISconf architecture is completely peer-to-peer; there are no
central servers or other single points of failure, and it is designed
for use in partially-partitioned networks such as DMZ environments.
The command-line client talks to a daemon which runs on each
machine.  The daemon, usually started at boot, handles distributed
file storage, locking, and network communications.
</P>
<P>
ISconf is not intended for use in environments where you want to make
manual, ad-hoc, or other out-of-band changes to machines.  If you
don't have the will to rebuild all of your machines from scratch so
you know what's on their disks, don't care about disaster recovery,
don't need to keep any of your machines in lock-step with each other,
don't need to test O/S changes before deploying them to production,
aren't as interested in O/S patch management, or still want to log in
as root on target machines and make arbitrary untracked changes, then
you don't want this package.  
</P>

<A NAME="toc5"></A>
<H1>BACKGROUND</H1>

<P>
One hundred years ago, automobiles were built by hand.  Each vehicle
was unique, composed of parts which were often crafted on the spot.
Repairs were expensive and frequent, owners needed to be mechanics,
fleetwide engineering changes were non-existent.
</P>
<P>
Then came mass production.  Today, a single automotive assembly line
produces vehicles of varying colors and options, all built from the
same basic design and tooling.  Replacement parts are interchangeable;
technicians bolt engineering changes onto existing vehicles with a
reasonable expectation that the parts will fit.  Economies of scale
have led to highly optimized designs, performance, and usability.
Drivers turn the key and go.
</P>
<P>
Most IT departments are nowhere near that sort of capability; they
still install and maintain operating systems and applications by hand.
Each machine is unique, reliability is elusive, users become
technicians, fixes often require re-engineering, most outages are
caused by other fixes, and infrastructure-wide changes are fraught
with peril if they are possible at all.  Even basic security patches
are, as a rule, applied sporadically.
</P>
<P>
ISconf provides some of the standardized tooling needed for
deterministic, reproducible management of UNIX machines -- the kind of
reproducibility you can count on for consistency, disaster recovery,
reliability, security, and auditability.  ISconf manages hosts over
their entire lifecycle following initial install, allowing you to
continue to test and deploy both major and minor changes well after
the target hosts have been placed into production service.  With this
tool you can safely replace kernels and bootloaders, install new
patches, packages, and tarballs, run arbitrary commands, and even
re-install the entire operating system under program control, and do
it all in a way that can be consistently reproduced on other current
or future machines.
</P>
<P>
Over the last decade, users of earlier versions of ISconf have found
that this consistency gives systems administrators enough breathing
room to "get ahead of the ticket curve", reclaim more of their nights
and weekends, and to, finally, begin to do more engineering and less
firefighting.
</P>

<A NAME="toc6"></A>
<H1>PREREQUISITES</H1>

<P>
To do deterministic and repeatable host management, there are some
things you need to do in addition to just installing and using ISconf.
Above all, you need to maintain a reasonable level of control over the
root-owned bits which you place on your disks, both during initial
install as well as throughout their lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
Automated systems administration is all about making self-modifying
code behave consistently.  If you don't start from a known state and
keep it that way, then you can make no assertions about how your
machines will behave in comparison with each other -- a change which
works on one host may not work on others.  Once you've destroyed this
consistency, you can no longer count on QA, disaster recovery, load
balancers, distributed applications, HA clusters, new deployments, or
even single machine rebuilds to work correctly.
</P>

<OL>
<LI>If two or more hosts are supposed to act the same, then you need to
install them from the same disk image.  This applies to rebuilds of a
single host as well as multiple installs of identical hosts.  See
<B>base image</B> in the glossary.
<P></P>
<LI>Your host install tool needs to be able to capture an image of an
existing machine, save it on an install server, then dump that image
onto subsequent machines verbatim, altering only those things which
are supposed to be unique, such as IP address and hostname.  Among
Linux installers, for example, systemimager meets this requirement;
kickstart does not.  Under Solaris, you'll need to use Flash Archives,
not Jumpstart.  See <B>checkpoint image</B> in the glossary.
<P></P>
<LI>After initial install, you need to manage hosts exclusively with
ISconf -- no manual or other out-of-band changes.  There is one
semi-exception to this rule:  You might want to use another tool to
manage environmentally-influenced configuration files.  You'll want to
manage the binaries of that tool using ISconf, and take care to ensure
that the external tool manages only those files which it must.  See
<B>environmental data</B> in the glossary for more discussion.
</OL>

<A NAME="toc7"></A>
<H1>FLAGS</H1>

<P>
Flags appear only after the isconf command name, not after
subcommands (as opposed to e.g. CVS).
</P>

<DL>
<DT><B>-c</B> <I>config</I>  </DT><DD>
    Top-level configuration file.  Defaults to /etc/is/main.cf.  
<P></P>
<DT><B>-D</B></DT><DD>
    Show debug info on stderr.
<P></P>
<DT><B>-m</B></DT><DD>
    Message -- human-readable comment describing the change.  Required
    only when locking.  This flag is deprecated and is likely to be
    removed; see the 'lock' verb below for how to provide the message 
    in a forward-compatible way.
<P></P>
<DT><B>-r</B></DT><DD>
    Allow reboot if needed.  Used only with the 'up' verb below.  Also
    see the 'reboot' verb.
    Ordinarily you would execute 'isconf -r up' from an rc script,
    which is a relatively safe time to allow reboots.  
<P></P>
    This flag has no effect unless there is a 'reboot' operation
    pending in the journal.  If there is a 'reboot' pending, then this
    flag allows the reboot to take place.   You only want to provide
    this flag at times when it's safe to reboot the local machine.
<P></P>
    Without this flag, if 'isconf up' encounters a 'reboot' operation
    during journal replay, the replay stops, an error message is
    issued, and subsequent changes are not applied.  You'll need to
    run 'isconf -r up' to continue past this point -- we cannot assume
    that the later changes will work without the reboot.
<P></P>
<DT><B>-q</B></DT><DD>
    Quiet -- don't show verbose output.
<P></P>
<DT><B>-V</B></DT><DD>
    Version -- show ISconf version.
</DL>

<A NAME="toc8"></A>
<H1>SUBCOMMANDS</H1>

<P>
Subcommands are often called 'verbs' in ISconf documentation and
usage.  They can be grouped into the following categories:
</P>

<A NAME="toc9"></A>
<H2>Changing disk state</H2>

<P>
    lock, unlock, snap, exec, reboot, ci, up
</P>

<A NAME="toc10"></A>
<H2>Branch management</H2>

<P>
    fork, migrate
</P>

<A NAME="toc11"></A>
<H2>Daemon management</H2>

<P>
    start, stop, restart
</P>
<P>
The following is a detailed description of all subcommands, in
alphabetical order.  In these descriptions, the <B>origin</B> host is the
host where a user executes <B>lock</B>, <B>snap</B>, <B>exec</B>, <B>reboot</B>,
or <B>ci</B>, and the <B>target</B> host is where a user executes 
<B>up(date)</B>.
</P>

<DL>
<DT><B>ci</B></DT><DD>
    Check in local changes, such as <B>snap</B> or <B>exec</B>, and release
    branch lock.
<P></P>
    Run on origin.
<P></P>
<DT><B>exec</B> <I>command args ...</I></DT><DD>
    Execute an arbitrary command.  Causes the command to be executed
    immediately on the local machine, and queued for
    execution on target machines after <B>ci</B>.
<P></P>
    Example:
<P></P>

<PRE>
      isconf lock "permanently shut down apache"
      isconf exec /etc/rc2.d/S85apache stop
      isconf exec rm /etc/rc2.d/S85apache 
      isconf ci
</PRE>

<P></P>
    If you want to embed shell redirects or pipes in the <B>exec</B>
    arguments, then you'll need to wrap the arguments in a shell
    invocation.  For example, this *won't* do what you want -- it will
    only change /etc/motd on the origin machine:
<P></P>

<PRE>
      isconf exec echo web server down &gt; /etc/motd
</PRE>

<P></P>
    Here's what you really want instead:
<P></P>

<PRE>
      isconf exec sh -c "echo web server down &gt; /etc/motd"
</PRE>

</DL>

<DL>
<DT><B>fork</B> <I>newbranch</I></DT><DD>
    Create a new branch from the current branch, and migrate the local
    host onto the new branch.  The
    original branch is the "parent" branch, and the new branch is the
    "child" branch.  
<P></P>
    If host A executes a <B>fork</B>, then it is the only host moved to
    the
    branch; hosts B and C do not change.  If you want B or C to move
    to the new branch as well, see <B>migrate</B>.
<P></P>
    Low-level implementation:  Since a journal describes the details
    of a branch, then a fork essentially just copies the entire
    journal contents from the parent branch into a new journal named
    after the child branch, then runs the <B>migrate</B> code path.
<P></P>
<DT><B>lock</B> <I>message</I> ...</DT><DD>
    Lock the branch.  Required before <B>snap</B>, <B>exec</B>, <B>reboot</B>,
    or <B>ci</B>, and recommended before <B>fork</B> and <B>migrate</B>.  The
    <I>message</I> will be recorded in the journal for each subsequent
    transaction until the next <B>ci</B>.
<P></P>
<DT><B>migrate</B> <I>branchname</I> </DT><DD>
    Migrates the local host onto a new branch.  In human language
    this means the host is going to change roles.  
<P></P>
    Switching a host to a new branch is only possible if the new
    branch is a child of the host's old branch, and if there have been
    no transactions executed on the host since the new branch was
    forked off -- in other words, the new branch's journal content
    needs to be a contiguous superset of the old branch's journal
    content.  If these conditions aren't met, <B>migrate</B> will
    exit with a non-zero return code.
<P></P>
<DT><B>reboot</B> </DT><DD>
    Reboots the machine.  Before reboot, adds a journal entry which
    will cause all target machines on this branch to reboot at the same
    point in their build.   For example, this is what you might do to
    install and boot a new kernel:
<P></P>
<PRE>
      isconf lock "upgrade to 2.6.20"
      isconf snap kernel-2.6.20-1.i686.rpm
      isconf exec rpm -ivh kernel-2.6.20-1.i686.rpm
      isconf reboot
      isconf ci
  
      # on other machines
      isconf -r up
</PRE>

<P></P>
    Apply thought when using this verb; 'isconf up' (without the -r)
    won't finish if there is a 'reboot' pending as the next action in
    the journal.  You need 'isconf -r up' -- and you don't want to put
    that in crontab, unless you really don't mind your
    machines rebooting at that time.  See the <B>-r</B> flag for details.
<P></P>
    Never say 'isconf exec reboot' -- that will only reboot the local
    machine, and will never create any sort of journal entry; the
    reboot kills isconf itself before the journal entry can be made.
    Always say 'isconf reboot' instead.
<P></P>
    By default, ISconf runs 'shutdown -r now' to cause the reboot.  If
    you want or need to use a different command, see the IS_REBOOT_CMD
    environment variable below.
<P></P>
<DT><B>restart</B></DT><DD>
    Restart the daemon.  Equivalent to a <B>stop</B> followed by a
    <B>start</B>.
<P></P>
<DT><B>snap</B> <I>filename</I></DT><DD>
<P></P>
    Snapshot a file for install on target machines.  Preserves the current 
    contents, permissions, and mode bits of the file.
    After <B>ci</B>, any target host on the same branch can
    run 'isconf up', which will cause ISconf to install the file on 
    the target host.
</DL>

<DL>
<DT><B>start</B></DT><DD>
<DT><B>stop</B></DT><DD>
    Start or stop the daemon.
<P></P>
<DT><B>unlock</B> </DT><DD>
    Break the lock on the local branch.  
    Use with great care.  
    This reverses the effect of a 
    <B>lock</B>, invalidates the work stored in <B>journal.wip</B> on
    the locking machine, and will likely require the person who set
    the lock to discard their work and/or rebuild the machine where
    the lock was made.  
<P></P>
    Generally speaking, it's better to pick up the telephone and call
    the person who set the lock, asking them politely to finish
    whatever they were doing and check it in, rather than use this
    subcommand.
<P></P>
<DT><B>up</B> </DT><DD>
    Update.  Causes the isconf daemon to attempt execution of any new 
    transactions in the
    journal.  Errors and messages are copied to stderr and stdout of
    <B>isconf</B> as well as to syslog.  Exits with a non-zero return
    code in case of error.
<P></P>
    If used with <B>-r</B>, and if a pending <B>reboot</B> entry is 
    encountered in the journal, then the host will reboot.
</DL>

<A NAME="toc12"></A>
<H1>ENVIRONMENT</H1>

<P>
ISconf behavior is controlled predominantly by environment
variables.  These can be set and exported before starting or
restarting the isconf daemon, or can be set in configuration
files, usually <B>main.cf</B>.  Any
variables set in the environment will be overridden by those set
in the configuration file.
</P>

<DL>
<DT><B>IS_DOMAIN</B> </DT><DD>
    ISconf domain name -- more or less equivalent to an AFS cell name
    or a Kerberos realm name; all of the machines sharing this name
    will share in the distributed cache that makes up the ISconf
    repository.  Normally you'd want all of the machines in a given
    legal entity -- the same corporation, for instance, to use the
    same domain name.   This is an arbitrary string, but by convention it
    is usually based on the DNS domain name.
<P></P>
    Rather than set this in an environment variable, you're better off
    populating the <B>/var/is/conf/domain</B> file, below.
<P></P>
    See the <B>domain</B> glossary entry.
<P></P>
<DT><B>IS_HOME</B> </DT><DD>
    The base directory which ISconf uses for data storage.  Defaults
    to <B>/var/is</B>.
<P></P>
<DT><B>IS_HMAC_KEYS</B> </DT><DD>
    The name of a file which contains a list of HMAC keys.
    See the <B>hmac_keys</B> file below.
<P></P>
<DT><B>IS_HTTP_PORT</B> </DT><DD>
    The port number which each ISconf HTTP server listens on.  Used only for
    file fetches between machines, and is likely to be deprecated in a
    near-future release.  Defaults to port 65028.
<P></P>
<DT><B>IS_NETS</B> </DT><DD>
    The name of a file which contains a list of broadcast and/or host
    addresses which ISconf should advertize file updates to.  See
    <B>nets</B> file below.  Likely to change in a future release.
<P></P>
<DT><B>IS_NOBROADCAST</B> </DT><DD>
    Boolean.  If set, do not send UDP broadcast packets; only send
    UDP point-to-point packets to the addresses listed in **nets*
    file.  Likely to change in a future release.
<P></P>
<DT><B>IS_PORT</B> </DT><DD>
    The port number which ISconf daemons use to communicate between each
    other.  Right now this is UDP only, but TCP will be added in
    4.2.7, and UDP is likely to be deprecated.  Defaults to port 65027.
<P></P>
<DT><B>IS_REBOOT_CMD</B> </DT><DD>
    The command which ISconf uses to reboot the machine in response to
    an 'isconf reboot' request.  Defaults to "shutdown -r now".
</DL>

<A NAME="toc13"></A>
<H1>FILES</H1>

<DL>
<DT><B>/etc/is/main.cf</B></DT><DD>
    Top-level configuration file for ISconf.  See CONFIGURATION for
    details.  As of this writing, ISconf does not distribute this file for
    you.  In earlier versions, we used to simply rsync it from a
    central server at the beginning of each execution.  In a near-future 
    version, look for it to be managed by the distributed cache.
<P></P>
<DT><B>/var/is</B></DT><DD>
    See <B>IS_HOME</B> above.
<P></P>
<DT><B>/var/is/conf/domain</B></DT><DD>
    Single-line file, newline optional, containing only the string
    which is to be used for the ISconf domain name.  See <B>IS_DOMAIN</B>
    above. 
<P></P>
<DT><B>hmac_keys</B></DT><DD>
<P></P>
    HMAC key list, one key per line.  See <B>IS_HMAC_KEYS</B>.  If this
    file exists and contains properly-formatted keys, then RFC 2104 HMAC
    authentication is enabled; wire messages which are not properly
    authenticated will be ignored.  
<P></P>
    The first key in the list is used for generating authentication
    codes on all outgoing messages, and is the first key tried when
    authenticating inbound messages.  If the first key fails to
    authenticate an inbound message, and if more than one key is
    listed in the file, then the second and subsequent keys are tried,
    in order.  This mechanism enables you to update the primary key 
    while preserving backward compatibility with older keys, allowing
    for a transition period.  
<P></P>
    When updating keys, it's a good idea to first add the new key as a
    secondary key to the hmac_keys file, and deploy that to all
    machines.  Once you're sure that <B>all</B> of your machines (and
    install images) have the new key, then move the new key up to the
    primary position in the file, leaving any old key(s) in the file
    as secondaries, then deploy that.  Finally, once you're again sure
    that <B>all</B> of your machines (and install images) are using the
    new primary key, then (and only then) should you think about
    retiring any old key(s).
<P></P>
    Take care when deploying this file for the first time on hosts
    which are already running ISconf; those ISconf daemons which get
    it first will refuse to listen to any which don't yet have the
    file; this will prevent further deployment if you're using ISconf
    to deploy the file.  To prevent this from happening, you can
    include the special key <B>+ANY+</B> at the end of the file.  If
    encountered in the file, this special key disables HMAC
    authentication of received messages, but does not prevent
    generation of authentication codes on transmitted messages.  What
    you want to do is deploy the file with one or more real keys
    listed in it, followed by the <B>+ANY+</B> key.  The file might look
    like this when first deployed:
<P></P>
<PRE>
      someauthenticationkey
      +ANY+
  
</PRE>

<P></P>
    As you deploy the above file, hosts will begin sending
    authenticated messages to each other using the
    <B>someauthenticationkey</B> key, but will ignore the authentication
    codes they receive.  Once you are sure that all of your hosts have
    that copy of the file, then deploy the file again, this time with
    the <B>+ANY+</B> key removed.  This will cause hosts to begin
    checking received authentication codes against
    <B>someauthenticationkey</B>, while discarding any messages not
    properly authenticated.
<P></P>
    For best security, each key should be about 20 bytes long; see RFC
    2104.  Keys can can include any ASCII character except space,
    newline, or the pound (hash) (#) sign.  Lines beginning with pound
    signs are comments.  Blank lines are ignored.  If no keys are
    found in the file, then the entire file is ignored, and HMAC
    authentication is disabled.
<P></P>
    ISconf checks for new versions of this file every 10 seconds when
    it is processing inbound packets -- there is no need to restart

<H1>CONFIGURATION</H1>

<P>
ISconf uses environment variables for its configuration, and these
variables are in turn passed on to any executables ISconf calls -- see
ENVIRONMENT.   These environment variables can be set in
/etc/is/main.cf.  The format of this file is similar to a makefile,
but whitespace is whitespace -- tabs aren't required.  Each stanza
looks like this:
</P>

<PRE>
      target: optional includes
          var1 = value
          var2 = value
</PRE>

<P>
The 'target' string above is matched against the hostname; case is
significant.  If it contains dots, it's matched against the FQDN.  If
it starts with a caret (^) it is a regex matched against the FQDN.
The first matching target is the only one used, however the special
target named 'DEFAULT' is always matched.  Variables set in DEFAULT,
earlier includes, or earlier in the same stanza are overridden by
identically-named variables which appear later in matched stanzas.
Comments are any text following a hash (#) on any line.
</P>
<P>
You can see the resulting environment by using the <B>-D</B> flag.

<DT><B>base image</B></DT><DD>
<P></P>
    An image which was created directly from vendor CD or another
    external source, and which contains an empty journal.  Normally as
    simple as possible, with only a management tool (such as ISconf)
    and its prerequisites added.  See <B>image</B> glossary entry.
<P></P>
    You will usually create only one base image per platform -- see
    <B>one-base</B>.  You will create at least one checkpoint image per
    branch.
<P></P>
<DT><B>branch</B> <a name=branch></DT><DD>
<P></P>
    Host model or type.  Similar usage as in software version control.
    A different branch is normally used for each set of hosts that
    need their own disk image and that do wildly different or
    conflicting things.  For example, a DNS server and a database
    server would tend to be on different branches.
<P></P>
    A branch is described by the sequence of transactions in a
    journal.  A new branch is created by forking an existing branch,
    then creating a <B>checkpoint image</B>.
<P></P>
    Branch names must match this regular expression:

<DT><B>categories of data</B></DT><DD>
<P></P>
    There appear to be three categories of data or executables on the 
    disk of a typical UNIX machine:
<P></P>
    <OL>
    <LI><B>evolvable data</B> -- this includes binaries and executables
    scripts, as well as most configuration files (see glossary entry) 
    <LI><B>environmental data</B> -- that set of configuration data which
    must match external conditions (see glossary entry)
    <LI>user or business data
    <P></P>
    </OL>
<DT><B>checkpoint image</B></DT><DD>
<P></P>
    An offline copy of the disk image of a given branch at a given
    revision, used to differentiate branches and for speedier
    installs.  A checkpoint image is made by installing a host from an
    ancestor checkpoint or base image, allowing its branch's journal
    entries to execute, then capturing the resulting disk content.
    See <B>image</B> glossary entry.
<P></P>
<DT><B>class</B></DT><DD>
<P></P>
    This is an anti-definition: the word "class" should not be used to
    describe anything related to deterministic host management.  It
    brings with it misconceptions, such as "hosts can be subclassed",
    "changes in the parent class can be automatically and safely
    propagated to subclasses", and so on; most of these misconceptions
    imply that <I>editing history</I> is a safe thing to do.
<P></P>
<DT><B>congruent</B></DT><DD>
<P></P>
    Remaining in compliance with a fully-descriptive specification.
    If a configuration management tool is congruent, the machines it
    manages will remain in lock-step with the desired state.  This
    makes it easier to maintain a representative test environment, and
    allows for more predictable disaster recovery.  ISconf is
    congruent.  Also see the <B>convergent</B> glossary entry, and:
<P></P>
        <A HREF="http://www.infrastructures.org/papers/turing/turing.html#methods">http://www.infrastructures.org/papers/turing/turing.html#methods</A>/congruence
<P></P>
<DT><B>convergent</B></DT><DD>
<P></P>
    Tending to converge towards a desired state.  If a configuration
    management tool is convergent, the machines it manages will trend
    towards each other in disk state, but for practical reasons they
    will rarely reach congruence.  It will be difficult to maintain a
    representative test environment, and changes will tend to be made
    first, and tested first, in production.  Predictable disaster
    recovery will remain elusive.  Also see the <B>congruent</B> glossary
    entry.  For more in-depth information about convergence, see:
<P></P>

<P></P>
<DT><B>domain</B></DT><DD>
<P></P>
    An ISconf domain name is more or less equivalent to a NIS domain
    name, an AFS cell name, or a Kerberos realm name.  This name is an
    arbitrary string, but by convention it is usually based on the DNS
    domain name.
<P></P>
    ISconf domains are a security mechanism, primarily in regards to
    information hiding.  All of the machines sharing the same ISconf
    domain name will share the same distributed cache, so root users
    on all of these machines will be able to read the contents of the
    cache.  Likewise, machines that are in different domains will not
    share the same cache, so root users of these machines will not
    have access to the cache contents of the other domain.  This
    becomes important if there is any proprietary or sensitive
    information stored in the ISconf cache, for example via a 'snap'
    or 'exec' command.
<P></P>
    Normally you'd want all of the machines in a given legal entity --
    the same corporation, for instance, to use the same domain name.
    For example, a small company using ISconf might use an ISconf
    domain name of 'example.com' on all of their machines.  A larger
    company might have multiple divisions or subsidiaries and legal or
    security reasons for segregating machines.  The large campany
    might put most of their machines in 'example.com', but for
    regulatory or security reasons might isolate a subsidiary into
    'foo.example.com', and might put their bastion and firewall
    machines into 'security.example.com'.  Note again that there
    doens't need to be a 'security.example.com' DNS domain for this to
    work.
<P></P>
    The idea of ISconf domains is to completely isolate legal entities
    from each other when sharing the same net.  Machines in different
    domains refuse to cache each other's data, answer each other's
    queries, and so on.  Domains really come into play in the TCP
    crypto and user auth code (ISconf 4.3 and later), where each
    domain has its own PGP keyring; its own database of hosts and
    users, and all of the wire traffic is encrypted accordingly.
<P></P>
    Establishing two machines in different domains means "I don't want
    these machines to ever cooperate at all.  I will never merge their
    branches, I don't want them to be able to share or see each
    other's packages, cache space, or wire traffic."
<P></P>

    with branches, see
    <A HREF="http://trac.t7a.org/isconf/wiki/DomainsVsBranches">http://trac.t7a.org/isconf/wiki/DomainsVsBranches</A>.

<DT><B>editing history</B></DT><DD>
<P></P>
    "Editing history" is what happens when you build a machine based
    on a set of instructions, then alter the instructions that you
    used to build the machine.  Once you've done this, there is no
    mathematically provable way to ensure that your new
    instructions will still build the same machine, short of building
    the new machine and then comparing the entire disk content to the
    old one.  
<P></P>
    In ISconf, editing history would mean editing the journal file
    itself -- while there's nothing (currently) which would stop you
    from doing that, and while the resulting file would be dutifully
    distributed and applied to the target machines, it's highly
    discouraged and may be a lot more difficult to do in the future,
    as we add things like digital signatures and checksums to the mix.
<P></P>
    Editing history can create major outages when:
<P></P>
    <UL>
    <LI>you're trying to deploy changes which worked in QA (using the
      old instructions) to production (using the new instructions)
    <LI>you're trying to execute a disaster recovery, or even a single
      host rebuild, and you no longer have the old disk content available
    <LI>you're trying to add a new server to an existing farm and don't
      have time to resort to backups or run rsync across both disks
    <P></P>
    </UL>
<DT><B>environmental data</B></DT><DD>
<P></P>
    Configuration data (usually files) whose content is predominantly
    influenced by external business, political, procedural, or
    economic factors, and whose function is critical to the integrity
    of business data or to the operation of ISconf.  Examples include
    files containing IP addresses, domain names, and other information
    which, if out of date, will break the ability of ISconf to
    continue journal replay.  See also <B>categories of data</B>.
<P></P>
    This version of ISconf does not attempt to manage environmental
    data natively.  In earlier versions of ISconf, we would simply
    rsync environmental configuration files (such as /etc/hosts and
    resolv.conf) from a per-environment server at the beginning of
    each execution.  We weren't real happy with the limited
    flexibility that gave us, but this method might work for you.  If
    you want to do this, either modify or wrap the main isconf script
    to call rsync, and then set up an rsync server somewhere.  See
    <A HREF="http://www.infrastructures.org/bootstrap/gold.shtml">http://www.infrastructures.org/bootstrap/gold.shtml</A> for more
    details.  (If demand is there, we can add an executable hook that
    makes this easier.)
<P></P>
    If a file meets the description of <B>evolvable data</B>, then it is
    not environmental data, and it should be managed via a simple
    <B>isconf snap</B>, rather than the means described below.  For
    instance, /etc/passwd and /etc/resolv.conf are usually
    environmental, while /etc/services and /etc/inittab are much more
    influenced by local applications, and in most cases should be
    managed via <B>isconf snap</B>.
<P></P>
    A better way to manage environmental data is to store the raw data
    (or pathnames pointing to the raw data) in /etc/is/main.cf and
    then generate the configuration files during boot and/or cron.
    (Look for an isconf verb in a near-future release which lets you
    export the content of /etc/is/main.cf as a shell script.  In the
    meantime you can do this the other way around -- call ISconf from
    a wrapper script which sets up the environment you want.)
<P></P>
    Your goal should be to keep the set of environmental data as small
    as possible, via architectural decisions in both infrastructure
    and applications.  
<P></P>
    You need to be able to examine each bit of environmental data to
    try to predict its behavior during deployment.  Your ability to do
    this will always be flawed -- you cannot possibly imagine all of
    the permutations that might be encountered during future
    operations.  Keeping the environmental data set small reduces your
    workload and the risk caused by a flawed analysis.
<P></P>
    You need to be able to test each bit of environmental data after
    deployment.  Any change in environmental data, by definition,
    cannot be tested anywhere except in its native environment.  If
    this environment is production, then we can only test these
    changes <B>after</B> deploying them to production -- this is bad, but
    unless you have completely duplicate networks, down to the details
    of IP addresses and hostnames, there's not much you can do about
    it.  Keeping the environmental dataset small reduces the
    variations between environments; ideally, IP addresses and/or
    hostnames might be the only differences you need to analyze and
    test for.
<P></P>
    The classic case of what <B>not</B> to do involves hardcoding IP
    addresses in executables -- we all know this is bad, but here's
    why: Embedding an IP address in a larger executable taints the
    entire executable, requiring that we manage the whole file as
    environmental data.  It's better to move that IP address to a
    separate configuration file, to shrink the size of the
    environmental data set.
<P></P>
    Executables aren't the only thing that can be tainted.  Embedding
    an IP address into a larger configuration file of
    non-environmental data also taints the rest of the configuration
    file.  If you have ever generated configuration files by merging
    IP addresses into templates of other data, then you have
    experienced this case.  By using templates, you prevent taint
    spread.
<P></P>
    Taken to an extreme, tainting of files and packages can cause an
    explosion in the size of the environmental dataset, and an
    explosion of risk, to the point where all data on disk must be
    considered to be environmental, and all changes must be considered
    untested prior to production rollout.  If you find yourself in
    this situation, your best bet might be to go with a convergent
    tool such as cfengine; you'll lose congruence, though, until
    you're able to fix the original problems and rebuild your
    machines.  See <B>convergent</B> and <B>congruent</B>.
<P></P>
<DT><B>evolvable data</B></DT><DD>
<P></P>
    Data which can be managed via journal replay.  This includes
    successive versions of executables, packages, kernels, patches,
    and configuration data which is not dependent on external
    environment.  See also <B>environmental data</B>.
<P></P>
    Examples of evolvable data include /bin/ls, /etc/mailcap, and
    libc.
<P></P>
    It's usually safe to assume that all data is evolvable until
    proven otherwise.  It's relatively easy to later begin managing a
    particular data item as environmental data if it proves necessary.
<P></P>
<DT><B>image</B></DT><DD>
<P></P>
    The bits placed on disk during installation; this will be either
    the base image or a checkpoint image taken from a child branch.
<P></P>
    This version of ISconf does not do image management (it's in the
    release plan).  Images need to be managed and installed using a
    certain category of host install tool.  See <B>PREREQUISITES</B>.
<P></P>
<DT><B>one-base</B> </DT><DD>
<P></P>
    One-base is an axiom of ISconf (and probably deterministic host
    management in general) -- it says that a host of any branch can be
    created by installing the base image for that platform and then
    replaying that branch's journal.  This means you may only need one
    base image for any given platform -- starting from there you can
    use journal replay to morph the image into any other image which
    is described by a branch's journal.
<P></P>
        "One base to start them all, one base to gild them, one base to
        boot them all and in the darkness build them."
<P></P>
    Sorry.
<P></P>
<DT><B>journal</B></DT><DD>
<P></P>
    The transaction log of all changes made to a branch, starting from
    the base image.  Used for replay on other hosts of the same
    branch.  
</DL>

<A NAME="toc16"></A>
<H1>INTERNALS</H1>

<P>
The basic algorithm that ISconf uses is roughly:
</P>

    <UL>
    <LI>Journal the changes that are going to be made.
    <LI>Preserve all entries in the journal over the lifetime of the
      infrastructure.
    <LI>Only append entries to the journal -- never delete, never
      alter or re-order.
    <LI>Apply changes to one or more test machines by reading the
      journal.
    <LI>Maintain a history of changes that have been applied to each
      host.  The master copy of this history should reside on the
      local disk of that host, and must be destroyed if the disk 
      becomes corrupt or the host is rebuilt.
    <LI>Later, apply the same changes in the same order on other
      machines, by reading the same journal, using the same code path,
      consulting their local histories to see what is yet to be done.
    <LI>(This bullet point not yet implemented in 4.2.X.)
      Keep track of those files which a human explicitly
      says do not need to be versioned, and in those cases (only),
      refer only to the last journal entry for those files.  An
      example is resolv.conf; in this case, you only want the most
      recent version to be applied, in order to ensure the host will
      function at all.  (But consider new, edited, 
      and deleted configuration files; these three operations actually 
      could make use of distinct handling.)

<H1>BUGS/RESTRICTIONS</H1>

<P>
See <A HREF="http://trac.t7a.org/isconf/report">http://trac.t7a.org/isconf/report</A> for bugs, and see notes for a
given release at <A HREF="http://trac.t7a.org/isconf/roadmap?show=all.">http://trac.t7a.org/isconf/roadmap?show=all.</A>
</P>
<P>
This version of ISconf was assembled with the features most requested
by early adopters, and does not pretend to be secure or scalable.  It
is intended for use in small deployments, trusted internal networks,
and evaluation.  If you do install this version in a production
environment, you should plan to upgrade as newer versions become
available.
</P>
<P>
Having said that, we do use this version of ISconf ourselves.
</P>
<P>
Because we'll need to change wire protocols to add in the security
bits, the next upgrade is likely to be a tricky procedure; you may
need to keep an old machine around for a while as a cache server
until you're sure you've upgraded all of your existing machines and
updated your checkpoint images.  Keep your rollouts small for now.
</P>
<P>
Known flaws in this release include:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>Files are transported via cleartext HTTP.  Any file checked into
  ISconf is visible by anyone with a web browser.  HTTP in general is
  a poor protocol for ISconf, is being used at the suggestion of an
  early adopter, and we plan to deprecate it as soon as we can get the
  consensus that it's the wrong direction.
<LI>Control messages are transported via UDP and/or UDP broadcast, for
  expediency.  This protocol is going to be deprecated in favor of a
  TCP mesh which will do both control messages and file transport.
<LI>No authentication or encryption is performed for any operation on
  the wire.  A properly-formatted packet can be forged to insert
  unsafe content into the journal for an entire branch.  We plan to
  add HMAC soonest, and later PGP signatures and either PGP or SSL
  transport encryption as part of the TCP mesh layer.
<LI>Each machine stores a complete copy of all files in the cache.  If
  you <B>snap</B> hundreds of megabytes of files, you will use hundreds
  of megabytes of disk space on each node.  Once the TCP mesh is up,
  we'll have a protocol capable of quorum counting.  This will let us
  starve the cache on ordinary nodes, while allowing designated
  "master" nodes to store a copy of everything -- the cache on these
  can then be backed up for safe-keeping as well.
<LI>We don't pretend to handle a certain subset of configuration files
  right now -- see the <B>environmental data</B> glossary entry.
<LI>Logging is rudimentary right now; everything gets dumped into
  various files in /tmp.  This all needs to be migrated to syslog
  and/or files in var log.
